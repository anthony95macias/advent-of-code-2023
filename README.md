# Advent of Code 2023 - Python Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenges, implemented in Python.

## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual set of Christmas-themed programming puzzles that cover a variety of skill sets and skill levels. The puzzles are released daily from December 1st through December 25th, with each day offering two related problems.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
advent-of-code-2023/
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                    # This file
â”œâ”€â”€ aoc-1/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                # Problem description and approach
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.py                  # Solution for Day 1
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ input.txt                # Input data for Day 1
â”œâ”€â”€ aoc-2/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ input.txt
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

Each day's challenge has its own directory containing:
- A README.md file with the problem description and explanation of my approach
- Python solution file(s)
- Input data file(s)

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher

No external libraries are required for most solutions. Any specific dependencies will be noted in the README.md file for the respective day.

## Running the Solutions

To run any solution, navigate to the respective day's directory and execute the Python script:

```bash
cd aoc-1
python main.py
```

Most solutions read input from a file named `input.txt` in the same directory.

## My Approach

For these challenges, I'm focusing on:
- Writing clean, readable code
- Efficient algorithms
- Thorough error handling
- Adding comments to explain my thought process
- Solving each problem in a step-by-step manner
